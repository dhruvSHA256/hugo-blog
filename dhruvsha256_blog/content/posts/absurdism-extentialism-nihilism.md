# Nihilism

- I know that there is no objective meaning outside the illusions we (humans) as a society created.

# Existentialism

- As humans, we have freedom to create our own meaning to live.
  
##  Essence
- make something what it is
- a defined purpose
- a meaning to life
- an essence, necessary for anything to exist


# Absurdism

- Constant tension between the hunger for meaning and impossibility of satisfying this drive
in a meaningless world.
- Stare in this meaninglessness and show middle finger.
- A fuck you to nihilism.
- Camus says we have three options to face the absurd:
  - Suicide: kill yourself ffs
  - Philosophical suicide: believe in some meaning
    (like religion, Marxism) without killing yourself,
    swallow a pill of bullshit basically
  - Acceptance: rebel, reject hope, embrace nothingness,
    don't make happiness a distant goal,
    spend time with yourself, be flexible, live with passion,
    you are giving away your freedom while you think of suicide,
    and choose love ....
